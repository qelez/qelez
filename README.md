# ABOUT ME

- Hello, I'm a developer who works independently with several programming languages. Over the past few years, I haven't been very active in programming projects, but I am still deeply passionate about technology and related topics. I have been involved in this field for nearly 10 years, continuously learning and exploring new tools and techniques. Despite my recent lower activity, my enthusiasm for programming and technology remains strong.

# LANGUAGES

- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/csharp/): The C# language was the first language I studied, and for a long time, it was my main language. I created cheats in CS:GO-type games, among other things. I have a total of 7 years of experience with C#, but because I used this language a lot, it became repetitive, boring and tiresome for me. So, lately, I haven't coded C#.
