# ABOUT ME

- Hello, I'm a developer who works independently with several programming languages. Over the past few years, I haven't been very active in programming projects, but I am still deeply passionate about technology and related topics. I have been involved in this field for nearly 10 years.

# LANGUAGES

- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/csharp/): C# was the first language I studied, and for a long time, it was my main language. I created cheats in CS:GO-type games, among other things. I have a total of 7 years of experience with C#, but because I used this language a lot, it became repetitive, boring and tiresome for me. So, lately, I haven't coded C#.

- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/docs.html): Lua & LuaU are the languages I have used most recently, mainly for creating scripts for Roblox and scripts for Gamesense. I have a total of 4 years of experience with Lua/Luau. During this time, I developed paid scripts as well as various scripts for different purposes.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/): I used Python to facilitate my projects in C# in certain situations, like dump and other related things.

- [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170): C++ was a language that made it easier at times to create projects and simplify things. It's been about a year since I last coded in C++, but it was a language that helped me a lot and that I studied for a year.

# SOCIAL

- [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1407649353383809044): My user is "qelez", I am a person who likes to talk to new people, whether it is random or programming subjects, I feel good communicating with other people, so feel free to send me a friend request.
